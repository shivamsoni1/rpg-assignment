## Assignment 
The application should have the following features:
- User authentication: The application should allow users to create an account and log in.
- Blog creation: Users should be able to write simple blog posts consisting of just plain text.
- Real-time notifications: Whenever a new blog is published by any user, all the users on the platform should be notified in real-time (without requiring a page reload) in the application itself.

To match our current technical stack, we prefer the solution using:
- Vue 3
- Node.js (preferred Nest.js)
- GraphQL
- **SQL database (required)** - Please use a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) for data persistence. This helps standardize submissions and provides more content for us to follow-up on during the review process.


### Notes
- This project has been set up with Vue3 (Not Nuxt 3) and Nest.js with Graphql. It has a hello world graphql and REST endpoint.
- For the purposes of this project, please avoid Firebase and other Backend-as-a-Service tools because they abstract away too many implementation details for us to properly grade submissions.

### Submission Requirements
- **Video demonstration**: Please submit a video demonstrating the app working. The video should show all the required features in action (user authentication, blog creation, and real-time notifications).
